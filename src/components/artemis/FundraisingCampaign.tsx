                <p>Across the world, brilliant minds are locked out of the institutions that shape knowledge &mdash; not by a lack of talent, but by geography, cost, and the closed architecture of legacy universities. The model that served the nineteenth century cannot serve the twenty-first. Artemis exists to change this.</p>
                <p>We believe that <em className="text-gray-800">access to world-class education should not depend on where you were born</em>. That <strong className="text-gray-900">academic excellence and global inclusion are not competing values &mdash; they are the same value</strong>. And that a university dedicated to <strong className="text-gray-900">freedom of thought, freedom of inquiry, and freedom of expression</strong> is not merely desirable &mdash; it is necessary for the progress of civilisation itself.</p>
                <p>Artemis is a borderless, network-native university built on three pillars: <strong className="text-gray-900">Broadening Access</strong> &mdash; bridging the gap between talent and opportunity regardless of geography or means; <strong className="text-gray-900">Advancing Excellence</strong> &mdash; personalised, research-driven education sustained by rigorous standards and technological innovation; and <strong className="text-gray-900">Guarding Freedom</strong> &mdash; upholding the democratic, humane, and international values that make the pursuit of truth possible, with freedom of thought and inquiry as non-negotiable commitments.</p>
                <p>Our operating philosophy is one of <strong className="text-gray-900">Foundational Efficiency</strong> &mdash; ninety cents of every dollar goes directly to academic programmes, student access, and research. We have no redundant campuses, no bloated administration. We have scholars, students, and a mission. The Founding Campaign provides the strategic capital to endow our first residential colleges, launch our Centres of Inquiry, and build the digital infrastructure that makes a borderless university possible.</p>
