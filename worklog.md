## Task ID: 2 — Redesign CampusLife.tsx for Student Life Vibes

### Summary
Redesigned the CampusLife.tsx component to give off "student life vibes" by removing grayscale filters, adding vibrant color photos, introducing an auto-scrolling photo strip, reordering sections, and adding warm visual elements.

### Changes Made

1. **Hero Section — Warmer & Color**
   - Removed `grayscale` class from hero image — now shows in full color
   - Changed gradient overlay from `from-black/85 via-black/40` to `from-[#1a0505]/90 via-[#1a0505]/50 to-[#1a0505]/20` for a warmer, sepia-toned overlay
   - Changed accent label from crimson to warm amber `#D97706`

2. **New "Life in Color" Photo Strip**
   - Added horizontal auto-scrolling strip of 10 vibrant Unsplash photos right after the hero
   - Photos show: students cooking, common rooms, sports, open mic, city exploration, outdoor studying, graduation, cultural festivals, coffee shop studying, group projects
   - Uses CSS keyframe animation (`scrollStrip`) for continuous left-scroll at 40s duration
   - Hover pauses the animation
   - Fade edges on both sides using gradient overlays
   - Warm background `#FFF8F0`

3. **Reordered Sections**
   - New order: Hero → Photo Strip → A Day in Your Life → Student Voices → Your Hostel Your Home → Clubs, Guilds & Societies → Traditions → Map → Stats → CTA → Footer
   - Student Voices moved up (from section 6 to section 4) for more emotional impact early
   - Map section moved down (from section 5 to section 8) so it's not the dominant first impression

4. **Color Photos Throughout**
   - Removed all `grayscale` and `grayscale group-hover:grayscale-0` classes from images
   - All images now display in full color
   - Hover effects changed to `hover:scale-105` for subtle zoom only (no grayscale toggle)
   - Added `rounded-sm` to image containers for softer feel

5. **Day in Your Life — SVG Time Icons**
   - Added `icon` field to each dayMoment: sunrise, book, bowl, bolt, wine, moon
   - Created `TimeIcon` component with color-coded SVG icons:
     - Sunrise (amber #D97706), Book (violet #7C3AED), Bowl (red #DC2626), Bolt (amber #F59E0B), Wine (crimson #8A0000), Moon (indigo #6366F1)
   - Icons displayed alongside the time stamps

6. **Student Voices — More Prominent**
   - Background changed from white to warm cream `#FDF2F9` (actually `#FDF2E9`)
   - Each voice card now has: white card background, left crimson border, shadow, quote icon SVG, avatar circle with initials
   - Quote text increased to 17-18px, font-light italic
   - Larger padding (p-8/p-10)

7. **Preserved All Data & Functionality**
   - All 24 hostels, 6 dayMoments, 6 societies, 4 studentVoices, 4 traditions, 4 campusStats retained unchanged
   - Interactive world map with hostel pins and info panel preserved exactly
   - All useInView hooks, motion/AnimatePresence, X icon, SubPageFooter imports preserved
   - goToPage prop interface unchanged
   - `max-w-[1400px]` container width maintained

### Build Status

Task: Build AI-powered chatbot assistant component for the Artemis College website

Work Log:
- Created `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — POST API route that accepts `{ messages }` and uses `z-ai-web-dev-sdk` to call the AI with a comprehensive system prompt about Artemis College (admissions, programs, research centers, Collegium Alliance, $100M campaign, campus life, innovation, governance). Returns `{ message: string }`.
- Created `/src/components/artemis/ArtemisChatBot.tsx` — Floating chatbot widget with:
  - Crimson (#8A0000) floating circle button at bottom-right (bottom-6 right-6) with MessageCircle/X icon toggle
  - Chat panel: 380px wide, 520px tall, white bg, rounded corners, shadow-2xl, subtle border
  - Header bar: crimson bg with Bot icon, "Artemis Assistant" title, subtitle, close button
  - Scrollable message area with conversation history, Bot/User avatars, crimson user bubbles, gray assistant bubbles
  - Input area with rounded-full text input and crimson Send button
  - Framer Motion animations for panel open/close, message appearance, button icon rotation
  - Loading state with spinning Loader2 icon
  - Auto-scroll to latest message, auto-focus input on open
  - Enter key to send, disabled state while loading
- Integrated `<ArtemisChatBot />` into `ArtemisApp.tsx` — imported and rendered just before closing `</div>` so it appears on ALL pages
- Build compiles successfully with `npx next build` — `/api/chat` route confirmed in output

Stage Summary:
- AI chatbot widget fully functional with floating toggle, animated panel, message history, and AI backend
- API route uses z-ai-web-dev-sdk with comprehensive Artemis College system prompt
- Component appears on all pages via ArtemisApp.tsx integration
